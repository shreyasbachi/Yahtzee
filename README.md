# Yahtzee Game in Java

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Java implementation of the classic dice game, Yahtzee. This project is designed to provide a simple yet comprehensive digital version of Yahtzee, allowing players to enjoy the game either solo or with friends, right from the comfort of their terminal.

Introduction:
Yahtzee is a game of luck and strategy, where players roll five dice to score in predefined categories. The goal is to make strategic decisions to achieve high-scoring combinations across thirteen rounds. Each player has up to three rolls per round to try for various scoring options, but each scoring category can only be used once. Strategy and foresight are key, as players must choose wisely based on their rolls and the current state of their score sheet.

Features:
Multiplayer Support: Play with up to six players in a single game.
Console-Based Interface: Easy-to-use, text-based interface for rolling dice, choosing dice to hold, and selecting scoring categories.
Comprehensive Scoring System: Includes all standard Yahtzee categories, such as ones through sixes, three of a kind, four of a kind, full house, small straight, large straight, Yahtzee, and chance.
Automatic Scoring Updates: After each roll, the potential scores for applicable categories are automatically updated, providing players with information to guide their decisions.
Dice Holding Mechanism: Players can choose to hold specific dice between rolls to aim for specific scoring combinations.


How to Play:
Start the Game: Run YahtzeeGame.java to initiate a new game session.
Enter Player Count: Input the number of players (1-6) when prompted.
Game Rounds: The game consists of 13 rounds, with each player taking turns per round. On their turn, a player:
Rolls all five dice.
Chooses to hold any number of dice.
Optionally rolls again, up to two more times.
Selects a scoring category for the turn.
Scoring: After choosing a category, the player's score is updated based on the dice roll and the selected category's scoring rules.
Winning: After all 13 rounds are completed, the player with the highest total score wins.


Installation:
No installation is necessary beyond having Java installed on your system. Simply clone this repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, and compile/run YahtzeeGame.java using your Java compiler.
